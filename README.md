# Understanding correlation stength between data sets

## For time series data 
We start with time series data and try to compute correlation strength between those signals. Typically most exploratory data analysis limit themselves to
linear correlation analysis. This project will first explore linear correlation strength between signals, but then move onto nonlinear methods of correlation
strength computation.
